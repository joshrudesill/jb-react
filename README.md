## Practicing with React - Website for a salon
This site was first built using plain html and css and bootstrap to figure out the design. After the design was mostly finished I began working on the full production build utilizing React for front end along with redux and thunks, and firebase for the server-side data store.

### Site Features
- All sitedata is stored on firebase firestore database for changeability and ease of use
- State management done with redux and redux-thunk. It also uses reselect
- It was designed using bootstrap. No templates were used at all its completely original
- Available in spanish and english using language switching buttons 

### Future plans
- Deploy site if business owner wants it
- Build content management system so business owner can make changes to site data
- Add form submission portal so business owner has an organized way to see if someone has used the contact form and respond

## Technologies used:
- React.js
- Redux
- Redux Thunk
- Firebase / Firestore Database
- Reselect
- React-Router
- Bootstrap / Bootstrap Icons
