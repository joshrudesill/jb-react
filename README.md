## Portfolio Project - Website for a salon
This site was first built using plain html and css and bootstrap to figure out the design. After the design was mostly finished I began working on the full production build utilizing React for front end along with redux and thunks, and firebase for the server-side data store.

### Future plans
- Deploy site if business owner wants it
- Build content management system so business owner can make changes to site data
